# Indexing and export

## Resource and IP indexes

The database has `resource_ip(name, ip, field)` with an `(ip, name)` lookup index. Indexing keeps this table in sync with `resource_summary`. Existing databases are backfilled with the explicit `hns-topology rebuild-resource-ip` command; schema migration does not hide that production-scale rewrite inside unrelated commands.

The derived IP index is built like a bulk index job: scan `resource_summary` once in name order, load `resource_ip` without the secondary IP lookup index attached, then create `idx_resource_ip_ip_name` after the load. New full bootstraps follow the same shape by deferring the lookup index until the resource rows are loaded.

IP lookup is built from a normalized `resource_ip` table into compact static postings consumed by the Name Audit page.

IP pages use compact Names references. For the common single-field case, such as provider-scale `GLUE4` addresses, page files store only a JSON array of names plus a field mask in metadata. Mixed-field pages store `[name, field_mask]` pairs.

High-frequency marketplace/default glue IPs are provider-rule signals. They match before the self-hosted rule, so an `ns1.<name>` plus shared default glue pattern does not get mislabeled as self-hosted. Known public HNS resolver IPs are also marked as resolver infrastructure if they appear in resource data. Both default parking and resolver infrastructure are excluded from actionable queues.

The Overview resource-IP, nameserver-host, and resolver inventory tables are paged under `overview-pages`. Resource IP rows link into the active-name static IP reverse lookup, and nameserver-host rows link into exact static nameserver reverse lookup pages instead of page-local text search.

Bulk page JSON is written compactly instead of pretty-printed.

Site generation writes a complete release tree into a staging directory and swaps it into place only after export succeeds. That removes previous-run `.html` and `.json` artifacts by construction and avoids publishing a partially written tree after an interrupted run.

## Current Names Export Shape

- Keep SQLite as the source of truth during indexing and export.
- Use static JSON for summary data and compact postings, not repeated row collections.
- Use one canonical sorted Names row store, with nonzero filter/provider/status postings into that store.
- Keep high-cardinality UI views paginated and decode only the current page in the browser.

Names filters use that row-store pattern: `names-pages/all` is the canonical sorted row store, while nonzero visible filters, provider queues, and `stage:<compliance_stage>` collections are ordinal postings into that store. The browser resolves only the active postings page back to canonical rows. Hidden filters, zero-row filters, and provider-type queues are not exported.

During export, the generator builds a temporary `export_name_ordinals` table with ordinal, provider, provider type, resource flags, normalized delegated-DNS TLSA evidence, and the derived `compliance_stage` for the exported name set. Nonzero posting collections are counted and streamed from that temporary export index, avoiding repeated joins across the production `names`, `resource_summary`, `tlsa_evidence_summary`, and `provider_summary` tables.

If detailed diagnostics must show every resource record at production scale, store full resource detail once per canonical name row or in sharded on-demand detail files, not once per filter.

For production, the web VM can remain a static file server. Further reductions should target posting compression, such as delta or range encoding for dense ordinal postings, and query-specific SQLite indexes if generation profiles show a remaining DB-side bottleneck.
