# Live Website Directory

The live website directory is an independent, low-cost service on `denuoweb-vm`. It is not part of HSD indexing, static topology generation, the weekly production cycle, or either topology publish script.

## Separation

The weekly indexer publishes its read-only topology snapshot to:

```text
/mnt/hns-topology/topology.sqlite
```

The live service reads that snapshot and owns separate state:

```text
/mnt/hns-topology/live-directory/data/live.sqlite
/mnt/hns-topology/live-directory/public/
/var/www/denuoweb/hns-live -> /mnt/hns-topology/live-directory/public
```

Replacing the weekly topology database or `/mnt/hns-topology/site` does not replace live probe history or the `/hns-live/` public tree.

The live-directory deployment also installs an explicit `hns.denuoweb.com` Nginx location for `/hns-live/` and refreshes the topology directory `index.html` plus its application asset. This lets the overview consume current live DNS/TLSA evidence without running the topology build or replacing its data files.

The live database keeps one current status row per discovered root/host pair and upserts it on later checks; it does not retain raw DNS packets, HTTP bodies, certificates, or a row per probe attempt. Name details use compact sharded static lookups regenerated on export from those existing rows, so the detail view adds no SQLite tables or probe-history growth.

The evidence queue compares the topology tip, height, provider-rule hash, and generation timestamp first. Its full candidate refresh is intentionally separate from the continuous probe cycle: `LIVE_SYNC_TOPOLOGY=1` requests it explicitly. This prevents a changed weekly snapshot from delaying shared-delegation and HNS-handoff probes while the multi-gigabyte topology database is traversed.

## Candidate Policy

The scanner imports active, actionable roots with direct HNS nameserver IP evidence from SYNTH or GLUE. It also treats bounded shared delegation and HNS nameserver-handoff cohorts as first-tier website signals. A handoff cohort shares the same nameserver, HNS root, bootstrap address, and bootstrap field; the probe first resolves that HNS NS handoff, then queries the delegated zone. This captures managed namespace patterns without requiring duplicate parent-side GLUE, while avoiding the largest generic parking clusters. The scanner creates only the root apex candidate by default.

DS alone is not a website signal. There is one explicit exception for an indirect HNS nameserver handoff: every active, actionable DS-backed handoff is first resolved through the configured HNS DoH resolver. Only a public A/AAAA result carrying DNS `AD` (resolver-validated) is admitted to the detailed HTTP/HTTPS scanner. This resolver-first preflight is route-independent and therefore includes bounded cohorts, singletons, and large shared routes; it makes no target web request itself. A resolver-authenticated no-address result retries after 30 days; a resolver timeout or other unavailable response retries the next day. Successful resolver admissions are refreshed after seven days.

Within the same due tier, the initial discovery order is:

1. exact-host TLSA evidence, including evidence-backed subdomains;
2. other stored DNS subdomain evidence;
3. DS roots with a global SYNTH/GLUE bootstrap;
4. unsigned roots with a global SYNTH/GLUE bootstrap;
5. recognized external-provider delegations whose NS address must be resolved at probe time.

Two compact priority indexes are refreshed independently on `denuoweb-vm`: shared delegation groups from the published nameserver shards, and HNS nameserver-handoff routes from `data/hns-handoff-groups.json`. The same handoff artifact also carries the complete DS-backed resolver-preflight set. A handoff cohort groups roots by the same nameserver, HNS root, bootstrap address, and bootstrap field, retaining only groups with 2–250 members for direct broad web sweeps. Separately, DNSSEC-signed singleton HNS handoff routes are retained as priority routes. Each route larger than 250 roots contributes at most three deterministic DNSSEC-signed canaries for direct broad sweeps; its DS members are nevertheless all eligible for resolver-only AD preflight. This lets the scanner target both like-resource HNS delegations and DNSSEC-valid indirect routes such as `shakeshift` without treating a shared route by itself as evidence of a website. TLSA-unobserved remains a broad remediation queue rather than a high-confidence liveness signal.

The topology overview's `DS + TLSA observed by live scan` card is sourced from the live-directory export. It counts only active roots whose current live authoritative DNS result has a matching parent DS, valid DNSSEC, and a secure TLSA response. Its coverage is shown alongside the count; it is not a whole-chain TLSA total and does not prove certificate matching.

Subdomain candidates require concrete evidence:

- a stored `_443._tcp.<host>` TLSA owner;
- an A, AAAA, CNAME, HTTPS, or SVCB owner in stored DNS evidence;
- an owner returned in a later authoritative answer.

`www.<root>` is not guessed. It is scanned only if DNS evidence names it. The service does not attempt zone transfers, NSEC walking, word lists, or recursive subdomain crawling.

Known parking infrastructure, public HNS resolvers, expired roots, private nameserver bootstrap addresses, and non-global website addresses are excluded from active probing.

## Broad Sweep

The broad sweep is separate from the evidence queue. Compact priority cohorts are read from published artifacts; only the generic fallback tiers stream roots from the read-only topology snapshot with persistent cursors. It does not create one `candidates` or `host_status` row for every root. Its priority order is:

1. DNSSEC-signed singleton HNS handoff routes;
2. DNSSEC-signed canaries from unbounded HNS handoff routes;
3. members of HNS nameserver-handoff cohorts with 2–250 roots;
4. members of shared delegation hosts with 2–250 roots;
5. DS roots with direct SYNTH or GLUE bootstrap;
6. other direct SYNTH or GLUE bootstrap roots;
7. DS delegations whose nameserver address must be resolved;
8. other delegations whose nameserver address must be resolved.

The sweep records one compact `sweep_coverage` row per root: resource hash, signal tier, checked time, outcome, and next-review time. A root is promoted to the detailed queue and public directory only after an HTTP or authenticated HTTPS endpoint responds. This preserves full liveness coverage without turning the live database or static directory into a second multi-gigabyte topology snapshot.

Broad probes first resolve A/AAAA and try both HTTP and HTTPS. When either endpoint responds, the same probe performs DNSSEC and TLSA collection before storing the result. This keeps unreachable delegated roots inexpensive while ensuring endpoint scans supply current TLSA evidence.

The configured production service uses 50 broad-sweep workers, a global ceiling
of ten target starts per second, and per-authority pacing. HTTP 429/503 responses
increase per-authority delay; repeated DNS failures place only shared authority
groups on a compact cooldown. The priority-index timer runs independently every
hour and reads the compact published artifacts only when they have changed. The
probe timer schedules another cycle 30 seconds after the prior one completes,
independent of the weekly indexer and deploy jobs. Its default cycle runs only
the indexed `hns_handoff` and `shared_delegation` priority tiers; the generic
root tiers remain explicit operator commands because they still read the
topology snapshot.

## Probe Semantics

For each due host the service:

1. Uses a global SYNTH/GLUE address directly, or resolves an admitted delegation's NS hostname, then issues authoritative A, AAAA, DNSKEY, and exact-host `_443._tcp` TLSA queries.
2. Validates the root DS/DNSKEY relationship and relevant RRSIGs when DS is present.
3. Tries bounded HTTP requests on port 80 with the correct `Host` header.
4. Tries bounded HTTPS requests on port 443 with the correct SNI.
5. Captures only response metadata and certificate hashes; HTTP bodies are not retained.
6. Treats HTTPS as authenticated when WebPKI validates or a secure supported TLSA record matches the served leaf certificate/SPKI.

Public categories are:

- `https`: an HTTP response was received over authenticated HTTPS;
- `http_only`: HTTP responded but authenticated HTTPS did not;
- `offline`: neither authenticated HTTPS nor HTTP responded, including HTTPS-only responses that could not be authenticated.

`LIVE_FALLBACK_RESOLVER` may name a trusted recursive resolver IP for NS-host and external CNAME resolution. When unset, the VM's system resolver is used. Resolved addresses are still restricted to global unicast before any authoritative DNS or web connection is attempted.

`LIVE_HNS_DOH_URL` defaults to `https://hnsdoh.com/dns-query`. The scanner uses this HNS-aware DNS-over-HTTPS resolver for the DS-backed indirect-handoff preflight described above and as a fallback when direct authoritative bootstrap cannot produce an address. If its response carries the DNS `AD` bit, the scanner treats the returned TLSA record as resolver-validated DANE evidence; set the value empty to disable both uses.

The public directory separates HTTPS endpoints, HTTP endpoints, and no-endpoint targets. A previously listed host remains degraded after one failed cycle and moves to the no-endpoint category after a second consecutive failure. Confirmed offline candidates use increasing retry intervals, while listed sites are checked every seven days. A changed resource and candidates first seen in the newest topology refresh run ahead of routine weekly rechecks and the older discovery backlog.

## Local Commands

These commands never start HSD:

```bash
hns-live-directory init --db data/live.sqlite
hns-live-directory sync --topology-db data/topology.sqlite --db data/live.sqlite
hns-live-directory plan --db data/live.sqlite
hns-live-directory scan --db data/live.sqlite --limit 100
hns-live-directory sweep --topology-db data/topology.sqlite --db data/live.sqlite --limit 500
hns-live-directory preflight-handoffs --db data/live.sqlite --limit 50
hns-live-directory index-delegations --db data/live.sqlite --topology-site public
hns-live-directory index-handoffs --db data/live.sqlite --topology-site public
hns-live-directory export --db data/live.sqlite --out public-live
hns-live-directory validate --public-dir public-live
```

The service command combines them:

```bash
scripts/run-live-directory.sh
```

`plan` is the no-network evidence-queue audit. A scan limit of zero is explicitly unlimited; each production cycle first performs a bounded 50-name DS-handoff AD preflight (four workers, at most two names started per second, eight-second resolver timeout), then runs HNS-handoff and shared-delegation priority cohorts before a 20-candidate detailed-evidence tranche. The generic DS/bootstrap sweep is intentionally excluded from the continuous timer because its unindexed snapshot scan can block priority work; it remains available through the explicit `sweep --tiers ...` command while its indexed backlog path is developed. The sweep excludes known parking and public-resolver bootstrap addresses. It samples a new shared authority up to three times, expands immediately when that authority resolves, and places repeatedly unreachable authority groups on a compact cooldown rather than repeatedly probing every root behind them. HNS-handoff cohorts use their own bounded route pacing and are not globally muted by conventional-DNS failures at an HNS bootstrap address; HNS DoH can still resolve that delegation. The cache contains shared authority keys only; unique roots remain compact per-root coverage records.

## Denuoweb VM Deployment

Review without changing the VM:

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 scripts/gcloud-deploy-live-directory.sh
```

Install or update the standalone repository, venv, static path, service, and continuous timer:

```bash
CONFIRM_LIVE_DIRECTORY_DEPLOY=1 scripts/gcloud-deploy-live-directory.sh
```

Deployment only initializes and exports the existing live database; it does not run a topology sync or website probe. The timer's first dedicated cycle begins after two minutes. To start the configured sweep immediately during an intentional rollout:

```bash
CONFIRM_LIVE_DIRECTORY_DEPLOY=1 RUN_LIVE_DIRECTORY_NOW=1 scripts/gcloud-deploy-live-directory.sh
```

Operational status:

```bash
gcloud compute ssh denuoweb-vm --zone us-west1-b --project denuo-web-site --command \
  "systemctl status hns-live-directory.timer --no-pager; sudo journalctl -u hns-live-directory.service -n 100 --no-pager"
```

The service runs as `den:www-data`, uses `Nice=10`, idle I/O scheduling, a 50 percent CPU quota, a 768 MB memory ceiling, and a single-instance file lock.
